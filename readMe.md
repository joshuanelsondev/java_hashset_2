# Car Service HashSet Exam

## Overview

In this exam, you will implement and test a simple car management system in Java. The key focus of the lesson is on the use of a **HashSet** to store car objects, ensuring that your implementation correctly leverages the properties of HashSetâ€”mainly uniqueness and efficient lookup operations.

Your implementation should work with the provided skeleton code, which includes:

- A `Car`
- A `CarService` class that manages car operations using a HashSet.
